Gameplay:

Gather drifting items from the \"Unfantomable Brine\" and bring them to the Fish People posts. Once you satisfy post needs it will disappear from 'the brine' and you must find all of them to return back to your life as sea captain.

Be wary though as your ship can only hold [u]4[/u] items at a time and there's no way to discard them other than giving them to the posts. Posts make a humming sound that helps you locate them from 'the brine'.

Controls:
W - Raise sail (accelerate)
S - Lower sail (decelerate)
A - Turn port (left)
D - Turn starboard (right)
E - Pickup floating items
F - Interact with Fish People posts (the big round things)
